# Solar System Simulation

This project is a 3D visualization of the Solar System using Three.js and Flask. It includes a representation of the Sun, the eight planets, and Pluto, each with their own orbit around the Sun.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was developed using Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with other versions of Python 3.

### Setting Up the Python Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies separately.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- On Windows, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
.env\Scriptsctivate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the project dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To run the Flask application, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server, and you should be able to view the Solar System simulation by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
